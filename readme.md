# Realtor APp

## Backend

Backend is created using nest with graphql mongoose, jwt.

## Frontend

Frontend is created using React with typescript

## Native

Mobile native side of the app is created using react native

## To get started

### Setup backend with nest

```shell
# Clone the repo

git clone git@github.com:rakeenali/realtor.git

# then cd into the cloned repo

cd realtor

# install all the dependencies

cd backend && npm run install

#then start the server usng
nest start
```

### Setup Frontend with react

```shell
cd frontend

# install all the dependencies
npm install

# start the app
npm start
```

## Setup Native side with React Native

#### Note

In order for application to work you need to host the backend on some kind of service.
I personally used ngrok but you can also do the same thing with localtunnel.

```
# go to the native

cd native

# install all the dependencies
npm install

# run the expo server
expo start
```
